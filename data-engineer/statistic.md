**Statistics:** Deepen your understanding of probability, distributions, hypothesis testing, and statistical inference.
## Statistics Roadmap

### 1. Probability
- **Basics of Probability**
  - Definitions: Experiment, Outcome, Event, Sample Space
  - Probability Axioms and Properties
  - Conditional Probability and Independence
- **Probability Distributions**
  - Discrete Distributions: Binomial, Poisson
  - Continuous Distributions: Uniform, Normal, Exponential

### 2. Distributions
- **Descriptive Statistics**
  - Measures of Central Tendency: Mean, Median, Mode
  - Measures of Dispersion: Range, Variance, Standard Deviation
- **Probability Distributions**
  - Understanding Probability Density Function (PDF) and Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
  - Moments: Expectation, Variance, Skewness, Kurtosis

### 3. Hypothesis Testing
- **Fundamentals of Hypothesis Testing**
  - Null and Alternative Hypotheses
  - Type I and Type II Errors
  - Significance Level and p-value
- **Common Tests**
  - Z-test, T-test, Chi-square test, ANOVA
  - Non-parametric Tests: Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test

### 4. Statistical Inference
- **Estimation**
  - Point Estimation and Interval Estimation
  - Properties of Estimators: Unbiasedness, Consistency, Efficiency
- **Confidence Intervals**
  - Constructing Confidence Intervals for Means, Proportions, and Variances
- **Regression Analysis**
  - Simple Linear Regression
  - Multiple Linear Regression
  - Assumptions and Diagnostics
